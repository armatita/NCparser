# NCparser
NC parser is a library built to parse EXCEL files with mining data into usable spatial and statistical information. It has several files to transform EXCEL information into ASCII and binary as well provide support for histograms, variograms, and so on...

## For the outside visitor
This library wasn't really made to be very friendly for the outside user. It was made as support to a project in mining engineering and it's purpose was to deal with lot's of data from EXCEL files. Since EXCEL file are extremely flexible it wasn't easy to parse all information to easily programatically readable files. It may be important to you however some of the functions inside such as an experimental variogram calculator or an "almost" general EXCEL file parser.

## Further development
Since the project is almost finished it probably won't have any further development. This repository is more about documentation than actual development. In any case if you wan't to know something about it just send an email to cerena.cmrp@gmail.com
